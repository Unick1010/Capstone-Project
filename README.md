# Capstone-Project
## Project Overview: Predicting COVID-19 Trends

**Goal:** To analyze COVID-19 data and build predictive models to forecast trends in cases and deaths. 

**Data Source:** CORD-19 dataset from Kaggle

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   * Clean and organize the data.
   * Handle missing values and outliers.
   * Create new features for better analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Visualize trends in cases and deaths over time.
   * Identify correlations between factors like population density, age, and healthcare access.
   * Explore the impact of government policies and social distancing measures.

3. **Model Development:**
   * Build predictive models using techniques like:
     * Time series analysis (ARIMA, LSTM)
     * Machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   * Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Insights and Visualization:**
   * Present findings in clear visualizations (charts, graphs).
   * Identify high-risk areas and vulnerable populations.
   * Provide insights for policymakers to make informed decisions.
     
6. **Key Insights and Visualizations**

Trend Analysis: Visualizing the predicted trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
Impact of Interventions: Assessing the impact of public health interventions (e.g., lockdowns, social distancing) on disease spread.
Identifying High-Risk Regions: Pinpointing areas with high transmission rates and potential outbreaks.
Resource Allocation: Providing insights for optimal allocation of healthcare resources

**Expected Outcomes**
* Accurate predictions of future COVID-19 trends.
* Identification of key factors influencing disease spread.
* Recommendations for effective public health interventions.

  
**Conclusion**
  
Predictive modelling offers valuable insights into the trajectory of COVID-19 and can inform effective public health strategies. By combining advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, accurate forecasts can be generated to aid in decision-making and resource allocation.
